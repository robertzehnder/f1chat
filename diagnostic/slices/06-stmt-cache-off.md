## Goal
Disable the statement cache for the pooled connection (Neon's transaction-mode pooler doesn't keep prepared-statement state across pool checkouts; cache hits cause `prepared statement does not exist` errors).

## Inputs
- `web/src/lib/db/driver.ts`
- `diagnostic/roadmap_2026-04_performance_and_upgrade.md` §4 Phase 6

## Prior context
- `diagnostic/_state.md`

## Required services / env
Production `DATABASE_URL` (Neon pooler). For Neon-config slices, requires Neon API token or console access.

## Steps
1. Read the current implementation if any.
2. Apply the change per the slice goal.
3. Add tests / docs as appropriate.
4. Verify against a real Neon connection.

## Changed files expected
- `web/src/lib/db/driver.ts`

## Artifact paths
None.

## Gate commands
```bash
cd web && npm run build
cd web && npm run typecheck
cd web && npm run test:grading
```

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Change is implemented and tested per the goal.
- [ ] Production-side behavior verified in the staging environment before merge.

## Out of scope
- Anything outside the slice's declared scope.

## Risk / rollback
Production-touching. Require user-approved sentinel before merge. Rollback: `git revert` + Neon-config revert if applicable.

**Status: REVISE**

### High
- [ ] Replace `Production DATABASE_URL` / "Verify against a real Neon connection" with a safe staging or dedicated Neon pooler target and specify the exact non-production verification command or procedure the implementer must run.
- [ ] Add a concrete gate or artifact requirement for the Neon verification in Step 4 / acceptance criteria; the current gate list cannot prove the required staging validation happened.

### Medium
- [ ] Align `Changed files expected` with Step 3 by either naming the expected test/doc files or removing the docs expectation from the step.
- [ ] Rewrite `Change is implemented and tested per the goal` into a checkable criterion that names the intended driver setting or test assertion instead of a generic outcome.

### Low
- [ ] None.

### Notes (informational only — no action)
- `diagnostic/_state.md` was updated on 2026-04-28T15:43:27Z, so no stale-state note is needed.
