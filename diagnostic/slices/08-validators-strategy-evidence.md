## Goal
Validator: every strategy-decision claim must reference an event in `strategy_evidence_summary`.

## Inputs
- `web/src/lib/chatRuntime.ts`
- `web/src/lib/contracts/`

## Prior context
- `diagnostic/_state.md`
- Latest healthcheck artifact under `diagnostic/artifacts/healthcheck/`
- Phase 11 redo will re-baseline; this slice's bar is just "validator runs and asserts the obvious thing"

## Required services / env
None at author time.

## Steps
1. Define the validator interface: `(answerText, attachedContracts) → ValidationResult`.
2. Implement the validator.
3. Add unit tests covering pass + fail cases.
4. Wire into synthesis post-step (after answer comes back, before returning to user). Validation failures get logged but don't reject the answer in this phase.

## Changed files expected
- `web/src/lib/validators/strategyEvidenceValidator.ts`
- `web/scripts/tests/validator-strategy-evidence.test.mjs`

## Artifact paths
None.

## Gate commands
```bash
cd web && npm run build
cd web && npm run typecheck
cd web && npm run test:grading
```

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Validator returns structured pass/fail with reason on test cases.
- [ ] Synthesis post-step runs validators; failures surface in `chat_query_trace.jsonl`.

## Out of scope
- Anything outside the slice's declared scope.

## Risk / rollback
Rollback: `git revert <commit>`.
